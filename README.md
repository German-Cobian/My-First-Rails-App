# My-First-Rails-App

An app which allows users to input a car (with it's make, model and year information) into a listing,  

![New car](/app/assets/images/New-car.png?raw=true "New car")

view that listing,

![Show cars](/app/assets/images/Show-cars.png?raw=true "Show cars")

edit the info on a specific car listing,

![Edit car](/app/assets/images/Edit-car.png?raw=true "Edit car")

or delete that car from the listing.

![Destroy car](/app/assets/images/Edit-car.png?raw=true "Destroy car")
